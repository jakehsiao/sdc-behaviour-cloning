# About this project
The project 3 of self-driving-car nanodegree in Udacity.
This project is about training a deep CNN to drive a car(predicting steering angle).
# The models used
First I use the transfer learning, use InceptionV3 as feature extractor and fully-connected neural network as regressor.
